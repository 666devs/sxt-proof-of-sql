//! This is an non-interactive example of using Proof of SQL with some sushi related datasets.
//! To run this, use `cargo run --example sushi`.

//! NOTE: If this doesn't work because you do not have the appropriate GPU drivers installed,
//! you can run `cargo run --release --example space --no-default-features --features="arrow cpu-perf"` instead. It will be slower for proof generation.
